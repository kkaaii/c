## Description

Given n objects you'd have to tell how many different groups can be chosen if r objects are taken at a time.

## Input

Input consists of less than 100 test cases. Each test case begins with two integers n (0 < n <= 50), m (0 <= m <= n). The next line will contain the labels (numbers in the range 1 to n) of the n objects you are to choose from. Two objects with the same label are considered equivalent. Then in the last line for that test case, you'd have m values for r. There will be a single space separating two consecutive numbers in a line. Input is terminated by a test case where n=0, you must not process this test case.

## Output

For each test case, print the test case number. And for each query number r, print the number of different groups that can be formed if r objects are taken from the given n objects. You can assume that for all input cases, the output will always fit in a 64-bit unsigned integer and (0<=r<=n).

## Sample Input

5 2  
1 2 3 4 5  
2 1  
<br/>
4 1  
1 2 3 4   
2  
<br/>
0 0

## Sample Output

Case 1:  
10  
5  
Case 2:  
6
