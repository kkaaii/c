# [Tree](http://poj.org/problem?id=1741)

**Time Limit:** 1000MS  
**Memory Limit:** 30000K

## Description

Give a tree with n vertices, each edge has a length (positive integer less than 1001).  
Define dist(u,v)=The min distance between node u and v.  
Give an integer k, for every pair (u,v) of vertices is called valid if and only if dist(u,v) not exceed k.

Write a program that will count how many pairs which are valid for a given tree.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n, k. (n<=10000) The following n-1 lines each contains three integers u,v,l, which means there is an edge between node u and v of length l. The last test case is followed by two zeros.

## Output

For each test case output the answer on a single line.

## Sample Input

5 4  
1 2 3  
1 3 1  
1 4 2  
3 5 1  
0 0

## Sample Output

8
