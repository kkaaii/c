## Description
Like everyone, cows enjoy variety. Their current fancy is new shapes for pastures. The old rectangular shapes are out of favor; new geometries are the favorite.

I. M. Hei, the lead cow pasture architect, is in charge of creating a triangular pasture surrounded by nice white fence rails. She is supplied with N (3 <= N <= 40) fence segments (each of integer length L<sub>i</sub> (1 <= L<sub>i</sub> <= 40) and must arrange them into a triangular pasture with the largest grazing area. Ms. Hei must use all the rails to create three sides of non-zero length. 

Help Ms. Hei convince the rest of the herd that plenty of grazing land will be available. Calculate the largest area that may be enclosed with a supplied set of fence segments.

## Input
* Line 1: A single integer N 
* Lines 2..N+1: N lines, each with a single integer representing one fence segment's length. The lengths are not necessarily unique. 

## Output
A single line with the integer that is the truncated integer representation of the largest possible enclosed area multiplied by 100. Output -1 if no triangle of positive area may be constructed. 

## Sample Input
5  
1  
1  
3  
3  
4

## Sample Output
692

Hint [which is 100x the area of an equilateral triangle with side length 4]
