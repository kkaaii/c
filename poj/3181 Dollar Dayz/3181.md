## Description

Farmer John goes to Dollar Days at The Cow Store and discovers an unlimited number of tools on sale. During his first visit, the tools are selling variously for $1, $2, and $3. Farmer John has exactly $5 to spend. He can buy 5 tools at $1 each or 1 tool at $3 and an additional 1 tool at $2. Of course, there are other combinations for a total of 5 different ways FJ can spend all his money on tools. Here they are: 

        1 @ US$3 + 1 @ US$2  
        1 @ US$3 + 2 @ US$1  
        1 @ US$2 + 3 @ US$1  
        2 @ US$2 + 1 @ US$1  
        5 @ US$1

Write a program that will compute the number of ways FJ can spend N dollars (1 <= N <= 1000) at The Cow Store for tools on sale with a cost of $1..$K (1 <= K <= 100).

## Input

A single line with two space-separated integers: N and K.

## Output

A single line with a single integer that is the number of unique ways FJ can spend his money.

## Sample Input

5 3

## Sample Output
