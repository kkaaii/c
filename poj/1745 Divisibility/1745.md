## Description

Consider an arbitrary sequence of integers. One can place + or - operators between integers in the sequence, thus deriving different arithmetical expressions that evaluate to different values. Let us, for example, take the sequence: 17, 5, -21, 15. There are eight possible expressions:

    17 + 5 + -21 + 15 = 16 
    17 + 5 + -21 - 15 = -14 
    17 + 5 - -21 + 15 = 58 
    17 + 5 - -21 - 15 = 28 
    17 - 5 + -21 + 15 = 6 
    17 - 5 + -21 - 15 = -24 
    17 - 5 - -21 + 15 = 48 
    17 - 5 - -21 - 15 = 18

We call the sequence of integers divisible by K if + or - operators can be placed between integers in the sequence in such way that resulting value is divisible by K. In the above example, the sequence is divisible by 7 (17+5+-21-15=-14) but is not divisible by 5.

You are to write a program that will determine divisibility of sequence of integers.

## Input

* The first line of the input file contains two integers, N and K (1 <= N <= 10000, 2 <= K <= 100) separated by a space.
* The second line contains a sequence of N integers separated by spaces. Each integer is not greater than 10000 by it's absolute value.

## Output

Write to the output file the word "Divisible" if given sequence of integers is divisible by K or "Not divisible" if it's not.

## Sample Input

4 717 5 -21 15
